# Curriculum Vitae
My long-format academic CV.

Design loosely inspired by [adrn/cv](https://github.com/adrn/cv) in addition to the [Clean Thesis template](http://cleanthesis.der-ric.de/) that I used for my PhD thesis. Both projects do some really cool stuff with LaTeX and I learnt a lot from snooping around the source code. Check them out =)
