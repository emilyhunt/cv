# Curriculum Vitae
Source code for my CV (long-form for academic job applications.) You can read it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilyhunt/cv/main/hunt-cv.pdf).

## Acknowledgements
Design loosely inspired by [adrn/cv](https://github.com/adrn/cv) in addition to the [Clean Thesis template](http://cleanthesis.der-ric.de/) that I used for my PhD thesis. Both projects do some really cool stuff with LaTeX and I learnt a lot from snooping around their source code.
