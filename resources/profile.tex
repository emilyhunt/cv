Astronomer with interests in machine learning and statistics. Highly skilled programmer with 10+ years of programming experience. During my Ph.D., I used Gaia data and various machine learning techniques to create the largest ever catalogue of star clusters in the Milky Way. I am looking to work on applications of machine learning to large astronomical datasets such as Gaia, Vera Rubin, and JWST surveys.
